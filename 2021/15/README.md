## --- Day 15: Chiton ---

You've almost reached the exit of the cave, but the walls are getting
closer together. Your submarine can barely still fit, though; the main
problem is that the walls of the cave are covered in
[chitons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiton), and it would be best
not to bump any of them.

The cavern is large, but has a very low ceiling, restricting your motion
to two dimensions. The shape of the cavern resembles a square; a quick
scan of chiton density produces a map of *risk level* throughout the
cave (your puzzle input). For example:

    1163751742
    1381373672
    2136511328
    3694931569
    7463417111
    1319128137
    1359912421
    3125421639
    1293138521
    2311944581

You start in the top left position, your destination is the bottom right
position, and you <span
title="Can't go diagonal until we can repair the caterpillar unit. Could be the liquid helium or the superconductors.">cannot
move diagonally</span>. The number at each position is its *risk level*;
to determine the total risk of an entire path, add up the risk levels of
each position you *enter* (that is, don't count the risk level of your
starting position unless you enter it; leaving it adds no risk to your
total).

Your goal is to find a path with the *lowest total risk*. In this
example, a path with the lowest total risk is highlighted here:

    1163751742
    1381373672
    2136511328
    3694931569
    7463417111
    1319128137
    1359912421
    3125421639
    1293138521
    2311944581

The total risk of this path is `40` (the starting position is never
entered, so its risk is not counted).

*What is the lowest total risk of any path from the top left to the
bottom right?*
