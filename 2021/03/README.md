## --- Day 3: Binary Diagnostic ---

The submarine has been making some <span
title="Turns out oceans are heavy.">odd creaking noises</span>, so you
ask it to produce a diagnostic report just in case.

The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary
numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things
about the conditions of the submarine. The first parameter to check is
the *power consumption*.

You need to use the binary numbers in the diagnostic report to generate
two new binary numbers (called the *gamma rate* and the *epsilon rate*).
The power consumption can then be found by multiplying the gamma rate by
the epsilon rate.

Each bit in the gamma rate can be determined by finding the *most common
bit in the corresponding position* of all numbers in the diagnostic
report. For example, given the following diagnostic report:

    00100
    11110
    10110
    10111
    10101
    01111
    00111
    11100
    10000
    11001
    00010
    01010

Considering only the first bit of each number, there are five `0` bits
and seven `1` bits. Since the most common bit is `1`, the first bit of
the gamma rate is `1`.

The most common second bit of the numbers in the diagnostic report is
`0`, so the second bit of the gamma rate is `0`.

The most common value of the third, fourth, and fifth bits are `1`, `1`,
and `0`, respectively, and so the final three bits of the gamma rate are
`110`.

So, the gamma rate is the binary number `10110`, or `22` in decimal.

The epsilon rate is calculated in a similar way; rather than use the
most common bit, the least common bit from each position is used. So,
the epsilon rate is `01001`, or `9` in decimal. Multiplying the gamma
rate (`22`) by the epsilon rate (`9`) produces the power consumption,
`198`.

Use the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the gamma
rate and epsilon rate, then multiply them together. *What is the power
consumption of the submarine?* (Be sure to represent your answer in
decimal, not binary.)
